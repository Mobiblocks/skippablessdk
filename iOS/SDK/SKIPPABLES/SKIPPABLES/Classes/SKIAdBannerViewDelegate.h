#pragma mark Click-Time Lifecycle Notifications

/// Called just before presenting the user a full screen view, such as a browser, in response to
/// clicking on an ad. Use this opportunity to stop animations, time sensitive interactions, etc.
///
/// Normally the user looks at the ad, dismisses it, and control returns to your application by
/// calling adViewDidDismissScreen:. However if the user hits the Home button or clicks on an App
/// Store link your application will end. On iOS 4.0+ the next method called will be
/// applicationWillResignActive: of your UIViewController
/// (UIApplicationWillResignActiveNotification). Immediately after that adViewWillLeaveApplication:
/// is called.

/// may have stopped as part of adViewWillPresentScreen:.

/// Called just before the application will background or terminate because the user clicked on an

/// before this.
